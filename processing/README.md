# Scripts to preprocess raw data downloaded from the TOAR database

First v1 scripts, which scrape data from the TOAR database. These scripts deal with DMA8 chemical data, and environmental data.

They are then merged in the merging script, done on a per country basis.

Data is finally cleaned, ready, with clean_combine scripts.
